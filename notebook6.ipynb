Accommodation: Renting a modest apartment or villa can cost anywhere from $300 to $1,000 per month, depending on the location and amenities.\\n\\n2. Food: Eating out at local warungs (small restaurants) can cost around $2 to $5 per meal, while dining at more upscale restaurants can range from $10 to $30 per meal.\\n\\n3. Transportation: Renting a scooter can cost around $50 to $100 per month, while using ride-hailing services or taxis can add up to around $100 to $200 per month.\\n\\n4. Utilities: Monthly expenses for electricity, water, and internet can range from $50 to $100.\\n\\n5. Health insurance: Depending on your age and coverage, health insurance can cost anywhere from $50 to $200 per month.\\n\\n6. Entertainment and leisure activities: This can vary greatly depending on your preferences, but budgeting around $200 to $500 per month for activities such as surfing, yoga classes, spa treatments, and exploring the island is a reasonable estimate.\\n\\n7. Miscellaneous expenses: This includes shopping, personal care items, and other miscellaneous expenses. Budgeting around $100 to $300 per month should be sufficient.\\n\\nKeep in mind that these estimates are rough and can vary greatly depending on your lifestyle choices.
