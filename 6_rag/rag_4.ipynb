       "AIMessage(content=\"Victory Mansions is a building where Winston Smith resides. It has glass doors at the entrance and is located in a grimy landscape. The hallway of Victory Mansions has a smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. There is a large coloured poster on one end of the hallway, depicting the face of a man with a black moustache. The building has seven floors, and Winston's flat is on the seventh floor. The flat is described as small and has a window overlooking the outside. The building is not well-maintained, and the elevator is often out of service due to the electricity being cut off during daylight hours.\")"
